# Machine-Learning
## Summary
To enhance user engagement on our platform, XportNusa, we've integrated a machine learning-powered recommender system. This system analyzes user behavior such as click frequency, purchase history, and viewed product counts. By leveraging this data, XportNusa can provide tailored recommendations to buyers, suggesting relevant products that align with their interests and purchasing patterns. This approach not only personalizes the user experience but also facilitates informed decision-making, ultimately optimizing the import and export process for our users. With continuous feedback and refinement based on user interactions, our recommender system aims to deliver valuable insights and enhance user satisfaction across the platform.
